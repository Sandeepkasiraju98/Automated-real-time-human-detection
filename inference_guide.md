This repository presents a high-performance, parallelized implementation for real-time human detection using advanced scientific computing techniques. The solution leverages YOLOv3 for object detection and incorporates parallel computing strategies via OpenMP and MPI to optimize computational efficiency across large-scale video and image datasets.
Please refer to the README.md file in the root directory for detailed setup instructions, dependencies, and execution workflows.
